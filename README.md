Literature Review of PubMed Articles Published on Artificial Intelligence in Radiology up to 2024

## Overview

This project presents the results of a bibliographic review of articles published on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Radiology, excluding Nuclear Medicine. The review was conducted using PubMed, with a focus on the studies up to December 31st, 2024.

This study utilized MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms to formulate search queries for PubMed. Formulas are available in Search_Formulas_Bib_Rev_IA_Rad.pdf document in this repository. This approach enabled an in-depth analysis of AI's role in Radiology across various sub-specialties and methodologies.

## Objetive
The objective was to study the **AI in Radiology research trends**: which imaging modalities and anatomical regions have attracted the most research interest up to that date.

## Methodology

1. **Search Strategy:**
   - A systematic search was performed on PubMed using MeSH terms and formulas saved in the Search_Formulas_Bib_Rev_IA_Rad.pdf document.
   - The search criteria focused exclusively on AI applications in the field of Radiology, excluding Nuclear Medicine.
   - The articles reviewed include studies and research published up to December 31st, 2024.

2. **Exclusion Criteria:**
   - Studies involving Nuclear Medicine were excluded.
   - Only peer-reviewed journal articles were included in the review.

3. **Data Extraction:**
   - The search results were filtered to focus on studies directly related to AI and its integration into Radiological practices, including image processing, diagnostic tools, predictive modeling, and clinical applications.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Absolute frequencies were calculated by year.
   - Correlation between imaging techniques and anatomical regions was studied using Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient.
   - Temporal trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, and appropriate graphical representations.

## Results and Conclusions
The results show a clear upward trend in research across all imaging techniques, with a particular emphasis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Regarding anatomical regions, the brain exhibits the most significant growing interest, as indicated by the Sen's slope analysis.

This bibliographic review highlights the increasing integration of AI technologies in Radiology, underscoring advancements in imaging analysis, predictive algorithms, and automated diagnostic systems. Key findings include:
   - Significant growth: A statistically significant upward trend for all techniques and anatomical regions.
   - MRI leads the way: MRI shows the highest growth in AI as a technique.
   - Neuroradiology takes the spotlight: This subspecialty is seeing the fastest growth in AI research, with the highest concentration of studies.
   - The hot spot: Brain MRI is the current focus of AI in Radiology, both in terms of the number of studies and the growth trend.

Overall, the findings provide a comprehensive view of the current state of AI research in Radiology, contributing to a deeper understanding of its clinical applications and potential future developments. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and professionals, guiding further exploration into AI's transformative role in medical imaging.
